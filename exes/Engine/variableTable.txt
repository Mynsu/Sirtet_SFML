# This might looks ackward, especially compared to constexpr
# in case that the hashing algorithm is altered,
# but helps user to catch up the duplicated value causing hash collision
# and to find easily which variable a hash means.
#
# You can add new variable with its hash generated by tools\HashGenerator,
# but should 'NOT CHANGE' any variable or any its hash.
# Do not forget that tools\HashGenerator is 'CASE-SENSITIVE'.
